The quadratic formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation
In algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form


ax^{2}+bx+c=0,

where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers, with a â‰  0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic, as there is no ax^2 term. The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term
